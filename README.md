# DeepLearning-PyTorch

This Jupyter notebook uses deep learning with convolutional neural networks to determine whether someone is wearing a mask or not, based on images of people's faces. This use of deep learning can be beneficial for technologies like mobile devices unlocking with facial recognition. PyTorch and Google Colab was used for this notebook.

This project is from Jovian's Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANS course. View the issued certificate here: https://jovian.ai/certificate/MFQTOMJZHA
